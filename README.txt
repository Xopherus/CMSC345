This is the source code for the project I worked on in CMSC 345 in the Fall of 2012. I was assigned to be Team Facilitator for the duration of the semester and I worked with 4 other team members to complete our project, called "Why Not Zoidberg?". The project description was merely to develop a shopping system where there had to be an administrator section for our customer to add/edit/remove inventory. We decided to build a bookstore using an HTML/PHP framework.

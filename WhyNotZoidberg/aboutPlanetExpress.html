	    <p>
	    	We are team Planet Express, in Dr. Susan Mitchell's CMSC 345 class for the Fall 2012 semester.
	    	We are all enrolled in the Computer Science major program at UMBC in Balitmore County, Maryland.
	    	We are working on creating this shopping system for our customer, Ms. Lisa Matthews. In no way, 
	    	shape or form, is this website actually a site for selling books. As you can see, we dedicated 
	    	this site to Dr. Zoidberg, the lovable alien creature from the hilarious TV show, Futurama. 
	    	Why you ask? Well, Why Not Zoidberg?
